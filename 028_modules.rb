# Ruby modules are similiar to classes when we consider that they storage a
# collection of methods, constants and others definitions of modules and classes.

# You can not create objects using modules. You can only define what what
# functionalities you want to add to your class or specific object.

# Modules does not support inheritance or hierarchy.

# Modules are good places to storage constants in a centralized place.

# Modules act as namespaces, alowing you to define methods with names that
# will not collide with those who are defined in another parts of the program.

# You can mix modules with classes, i.e., you can include modules inside classes.
# When you do this, all the instance module methods become available as if it had
# been defined by the class.
